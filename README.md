# Digital Twins Ecosystems and Applications @ PerCom

DIGITA is an annual workshop series dedicated to exploring the latest research, trends, and applications in Digital Twins, hosted at the IEEE Pervasive Computing and Communications conference (PerCom). The workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss innovative solutions, share experiences, and foster collaborations in the field of digital twin technologies and their ecosystems.

DIGITA originated from the [MADTECC](https://madtecc.github.io/) workshop, which was held at PerCom 2024, and has since evolved into a dedicated platform for advancing digital twin research and applications.
